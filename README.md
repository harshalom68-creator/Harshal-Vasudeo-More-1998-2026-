College / University (Second — Detailed, Verbatim)
• Institution: Sinhgad College of Engineering, Pune
I was totally isolated. No friends, no relationships. I stopped going to college
regularly and lost interest in engineering. However, I was one of the top robotics
players in the country. I traveled a lot and made significant money by winning prizes.
Psoriasis, hair loss, and weight gain due to hypothyroidism did not stop me at that
time because I was doing great in robotics and hence was hopeful about the future.
Then I suddenly decided to prepare for UPSC CSE.
Unfortunately, due to this decision, I started ignoring college completely. Grades
suffered, no internships, opted out of placements. Due to isolation and confidence
issues, I never built friends or a network and never understood different career
paths.
I did not even know that 5 years of hard work after CDAC could make someone earn
extremely high salaries. I had no idea. There was no guidance in UPSC preparation.
No one told me UPSC was a gamble.
This decision marked the real downfall.
After graduation, I studied for UPSC but could never give an honest attempt. I
struggled financially because family support was unreliable.
Eventually, I shifted to CAT preparation in 2023. Even after three attempts, I failed.
My final attempt in November 2025 went horribly.
By this time, nothing about me gave me hope.
Psoriasis worsened. Constant medicines and side effects. Urticaria. Weight gain.
Poor diet. Toxic family environment. Financial struggles. CDAC was no longer an
option. Parents pressured me to take a dead-end job.
This time, even hard work, intelligence, or robotics could not save me.

cannot fully blame them

• Long-term impact: Mixed
12. Romantic & Sexual Life

33. Post-Death / Afterlife Exploration Agenda
Exploration of Reality
• I will explore planets, stars, galaxies, solar systems — the entirety of the
physical universe.
• I will explore the complete physical world and its structure at every scale.
• I will investigate whether God exists, and if so, what form God takes.
• I will study the system that governs everything in the universe.
• I will attempt to understand how reality itself functions.
Truth-Seeking & Fundamental Questions
• I will explore the reality behind all religions.
• I will seek answers to why there is so much suffering.
• I will examine whether suffering is necessary, accidental, imposed, or
systemic.
• I will investigate whether the universe is governed by fairness, randomness,
or something else entirely.
Learning & Growth
• I will learn engineering, physics, sociology, and political science.
• I will continue learning without biological, physical, or time constraints.
• I will follow and observe other personalities who have passed away.
• I will learn from them directly if interaction is possible.
Experimentation & Capabilities
• I will conduct infinite experiments.
• I will experiment with consciousness, reality, perception, and existence.
• I will attempt to travel at the speed of light, or faster, if possible.
• I will test the limits of movement, awareness, and knowledge.
Relationships & Interaction with the Living
• I will attempt to communicate with my loved ones who are still alive.
• I will try to help them induce out-of-body experiences (OBEs).
• If successful, I will spend time with them during such experiences.
• I will try to guide or help them without causing harm or interference.
Reincarnation Policy
• I will choose not to reincarnate immediately.
• I will remain in the afterlife to learn and grow as a soul.
• I will postpone reincarnation for as long as possible.
• I will reincarnate only if I become bored in the afterlife.
Reincarnation Preferences
• My first reincarnation, if chosen, will be as a cute kitty cat.
• The purpose of this reincarnation will be rest and relaxation.
• I will choose a low-stakes existence with no pressure or burden.
Constraints on Future Lives
• I will never choose extreme challenges during identity-forming years.
• I will avoid early-life suffering that can permanently damage confidence or
identity.
• I will not repeat experiences like psoriasis and hair loss during formative
years.
• I will ensure reduced severity if reincarnation is necessary.
Final Position
• I will postpone reincarnation as long as possible.
• Reincarnation will be a choice, not an obligation.
• Learning and growth will come before return.
Closing Quote
If a task remained incomplete, justice demands another attempt.
Repetition without reduced burden is not growth but punishment.
A fair system corrects conditions — or the cycle itself is meaningless.
ADDENDUM A — Additional Reincarnation
Preference
(Appended to Section 30: Desired Conditions in Next Life)
• Next reincarnation geographic preference:
A developed world with strong institutions and higher baseline stability — preferably
the United States, United Kingdom, or Germany.
ADDENDUM B — Startup & Funding Attempts
(Appended to Section 16: Work & Career)
• I applied for seed funding to multiple venture capital firms.
• Received no responses, primarily due to zero traction.
• Early traction could have been generated if my parents had provided initial
financial support, which they were capable of but unwilling to give.
• I understand their nature; hence, no resentment.
• Despite this, my startup was shortlisted for Phase 2 of Shark Tank India,
Season 5.
• With minimal early financial backing from family, the startup could have
worked.
• Outcome accepted without regret.
ADDENDUM C — Verified Social & Digital Presence
(Appended to Section 17: Robotics & Technical Output, and cross-referenced with
Section 31: Recognition Triggers)
